# The Sqrrl Programming Language
The main source code repository for the Sqrrl Programming Language, the core libraries, documentation and examples.
This language is aimed at creating a better C language that doesn't include all the crazyness in C++.
Currently it will be targeted for Windows but most of the code should be written using platform independant code, 
so porting will not be an issue. 
This is a reboot from an old version of the compiler, over time my personal coding style and preferences have
changed and instead of cleaning up my mess I decided to start over.
